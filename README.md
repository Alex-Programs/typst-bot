# Typst Bot

A Discord bot that renders Typst code.

Built with poise so it has all the goodies like edit tracking, typing status, and automatic help generation.

## Hosting

To set up, copy the built binary and the `fonts` directory from the repo into a directory which will be the bot's working directory.

To run, enter the bot's working directory, set `DISCORD_TOKEN` to your bot token, and run the binary.

## License

AGPL. Use `?source` to get a link to the source from deployments of the bot.
